Student:
	SID (primary key)
	First_name
	last_name
Professor:
	PID (primary key)
	First_name
	last_name
Course: 
	CID (primary key)
	course_name
	semester
	section_num
	exam date
	PID (as foreign key) all except CID would be unique 
Courses Taken (by a student):
	SID (references student table)
	CID (references course table), primary key would be the combination of CID and SID the edge case is that the student takes the 		same course twice, but thatâ€™s okay because the CID would be different
